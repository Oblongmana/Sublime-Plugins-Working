To install, open a terminal and type 

    bash <(curl https://raw.github.com/Oblongmana/Sublime-Plugins-Working/master/Gist%20Dex/install.sh)


Note that this will probably only work on OSX, with a standard looking ST2 install.

Alternatively, clone the repo, and copy the Gist Dex folder into your ST2 packages folder.
